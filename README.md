# Animal_behaviour-Project
Master Thesis for Real-time web comunication
V0.1 - added project to GIT. Features included: 
     - get animals from server
     - receive animals in the animal area
     - user can click on each animal, creating an object with animal name in the       process
V0.2 - finished implementing the basic functionality of the get_behaviour.
       For each animal clicked, the actions for that animal are returned in the behaviour area along with the animal name.
       Added the readme log for keeping track on the changes.                                              
V0.3 - restricted the "get_animal" button to only once.
     - started working on the "start_cycle" button, as of now it returns the 
       whole animal object from the behaviour area.
